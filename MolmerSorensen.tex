\begin{abstract}
	Here we look at soc-ed bose gas with modulation. Technique generalizes the proposal of (Karina) and opens the door to generating cyclic couplings between $m_f=+1$ and $m_f=+1$ we propose a new method of probing the energy-momentum dispersion of a spin-orbit coupled quantum gas

%\begin{addendum}
%\item We appreciate useful discussions with Stefan Natu.  This work was partially supported by the ARO's atomtronics MURI, by the AFOSR's Quantum Matter MURI, NIST, and the NSF through the PFC at the JQI.
 
%\item[Author Contributions] All authors excepting I.B.S contributed to the data taking effort.  All authors: analyzed data; performed numerical and analytical calculations; and contributed to writing the manuscript.  I.B.S. proposed the initial experiment (with great enthusiasm, but with little appreciation for the many technical hurdles to be resolved by the remainder of the team).

%\item[Correspondence] Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to I.B.S.~ (email: ian.spielman@nist.gov).
