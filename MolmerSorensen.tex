\begin{abstract}
	%Here we look at soc-ed bose gas with modulation. Technique generalizes the proposal of (Karina) and opens the door to generating cyclic couplings between $m_f=+1$ and $m_f=+1$ we propose a new method of probing the energy-momentum dispersion of a spin-orbit coupled quantum gas
	
%	The coupling between an electron's spin and motion lies withing the heart cool things in condensed matter systems. The high degree of control in cold atoms systems makes them ideal candidates for studying new phases of matter and simulating quantum systems.
	 We propose a time domain technique to measure the band structure of a spin-1 spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate that relies on the Hamiltonian evolution of the system. We drive transitions at different values of detuning from Raman resonance and extract the Fourier components of the time dependent evolution to reconstruct the spin and momentum dependent energy spectrum. We add a periodic modulation to one Raman field which results in a tunable spin-orbit coupling dispersion and a spectrum of Floquet quasi-energies that we can directly measure, showing the robustness of our technique.

%\begin{addendum}
%\item We appreciate useful discussions with Stefan Natu.  This work was partially supported by the ARO's atomtronics MURI, by the AFOSR's Quantum Matter MURI, NIST, and the NSF through the PFC at the JQI.
 
%\item[Author Contributions] All authors excepting I.B.S contributed to the data taking effort.  All authors: analyzed data; performed numerical and analytical calculations; and contributed to writing the manuscript.  I.B.S. proposed the initial experiment (with great enthusiasm, but with little appreciation for the many technical hurdles to be resolved by the remainder of the team).

%\item[Correspondence] Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to I.B.S.~ (email: ian.spielman@nist.gov).
