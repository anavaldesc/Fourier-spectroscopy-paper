\section{Results}
Put a plot with time evolution and fit. One for simple soc case, one for Molmer-Sorensen case. Fourier trasform and spectra. One image that shows how it is done and then several other spectra. It would be great if I show both tunability and and Floquet bands. Effective mass measurement data? Show higher harmonics. Spin resolved spectroscopy.
