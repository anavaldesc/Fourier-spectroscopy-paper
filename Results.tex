\section{Results}
\subsection{Dispersion relations}
Here put some pretty plots. 
\subsection{Coupling strength and detuning calibrations}
Both Raman lasers were generated by diode laser with frequency set at $790.024$ nm, the magic wavelength of $Rb^{87}$. We offset their frequency using two acousto-optic modulators, one driven at a single frequency near 80 MHz, and the second one driven with a superposition  of up to 3 frequencies. We detune the Raman lasers by changing the driving frequency of the AOMs while keeping the bias magnetic field constant. We calibrated the Raman coupling strength $\Omega$ and the detuning from Raman resonance $\Delta$ by fitting the three-level Rabi oscillations of the $m_F=0$ and $m_f=\pm 1$ states to the time evolution given by the Hamiltonian in Eq. \ref{Eq:SOCone}.

Put a plot with time evolution and fit. One for simple soc case, one for Molmer-Sorensen case. Fourier trasform and spectra. One image that shows how it is done and then several other spectra. It would be great if I show both tunability and and Floquet bands. Effective mass measurement data? Show higher harmonics. Spin resolved spectroscopy. 

\subsection{Dark states at $q=0$}
