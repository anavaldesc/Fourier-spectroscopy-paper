\section{Experiment}

We are interested in measuring the SOC dispersion for three different types of coupling schemes: (i) A time independent spin-orbit coupled system, $\Omega_0\neq0$ and $\Omega=0$, (ii) for a periodically driven spin-orbit coupled system with no DC offset $\Omega\neq0$ and $\Omega_0=0$, and (iii) A time periodically driven spin-orbit coupled system with a DC offset $\Omega\neq0$ and $\Omega_0\neq0$. 

\subsection{Spectroscopy experimental sequence}


We start our experiments with a Rb$^{87}$ Bose-Einstein condensate \cite{lin_rapid_2009} (BEC) with $N\approx 4\times 10^4$ (measure) atoms in the $\ket{F=1,m_F=0}$ state, confined in a $1064\nm$ crossed optical dipole trap, with trapping frequencies $(\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z)=2\pi(42(3),34(2),133(3))\ \Hz$. We break the degeneracy between the $m_F$ magnetic sub-levels by applying a $17.0556$ G bias field along the z axis, which produces a Zeeman splitting of $12 \ \MHz$ and a quadratic Zeeman shift that lowers the energy of the $\ket{F=1,m_F=0}$ state  by $20.9851$ kHz. We adiabatically prepare our BEC in the $\ket{m_F=0}$ by slowly ramping the bias field while applying a $12\MHz$ radio-frequency field. We then apply a pair of microwave pulses that serve to monitor and stabilize the bias field and. We generate spin-orbit coupling between the magnetic sub levels with a pair of intersecting, cross-polarized Raman beams, with wavelength $\lambda=790.024 nm$ propagating along $\mathbf{e}_x+\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{e}_x-\mathbf{e}_y$ as shown in Fig 1a. We offset the frequency of the beams using two acusto optic modulators (AOMs), one of them driven by a superposition of up to three different frequencies. On resonance, the laser frequencies satisfy the condition $\omega_A-\omega_B=\omega_A-\frac{\omega_{B+}+\omega_{B-}}{2}=\omega_Z$, and we change the Raman detuning $\Delta_0$ by keeping the magnetic field constant and changing the value of the frequency $\omega_A$.

To get our probability amplitude measurements, we keep the detuning value $\Delta_0$ fixed and pulse the Raman beams on for time intervals between $5\us$ and up to $900\us$. For the time independent SOC measurements (case (i)) we take a total of 120 different pulses, for the periodically driven SOC measurements (cases (ii) and (iii)) which require better resolution and bandwidth, we take a total of 180 pulses. After pulsing the Raman we release our atoms from the optical dipole trap and let them fall for a $21$ ms time of flight (TOF) time before and apply a spin-dependent force using magnetic field gradient. Our absorption images reveal the atoms spin and momentum distribution, from which we can extract the probability amplitudes by counting the fractional number of atoms in each spin and quasimomentum state. We repeat this procedure for values of Raman detuning within the interval $\pm 12 E_L$ which corresponds to quasimomentum values within $\pm 3k_L$.

The time dependent SOC measurements additionally required phase stability between the 3 frequency components in the Raman B field. We set all the relative phases to zero at the beginning of each pulse and kept it constant throughout our experiments. We made the choice of zero relative phase as it maximizes the effective couplings $\Omega$ and $\Omega_0$ for a given field intensity. For a more detailed discussion of the effect of the relative phases see the Appendix section (?). 

\subsection{Effective mass measurement}

We measure the atom's ground state effective mass by adiabatically preparing our BECs in the lowest eigenstate and inducing dipole oscillations.The effective mass $m^{\star}$ of the dressed atoms  is related to the bare mass $m$ and the bare and dressed trapping frequencies $\omega$ and $\omega^{\star}$ by the ratio $m^{\star}/m=\sqrt{\omega^{\star}/\omega}$. We prepare our system in the  $\ket{m_F=0,\ k_x=0}$ and adiabatically turn on the Raman in $\approx10$ ms while also ramping the detuning to a non-zero value, around $0.5\Er$. Our system does not have the capability to dynamically change the laser frequency while maintaining phase stability, so unlike the pulsing experiments, we ramped the magnetic field to change the resonance conditions. This detuning shifts the minima in the ground state energy away from zero quasi-momentum. We then suddenly snap the field back to resonance which changes the equilibrium conditions of the system and excites the dipole mode of our optical dipole trap. To measure the bare state frequency, we use the Raman beams to initially excite the dipole mode of the trap but we quickly turn off the field ($\sim1\ms$) and let the BEC continue to oscillate in the unmodified dipole potential. 

For this set of measurements we modified our trapping frequencies to $(\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z)=2\pi(35.9, 32.5, xx) \Hz$  so that they were nominally symmetric along the $x-y$ plane. 

\subsection{Magnetic field stabilization}
We stabilized the magnetic field and measured fluctuations about the desired set point by applying a pair of microwave pulses with frequencies close to resonance from the $5^2{\rm S}_{1/2}$ $F=2$ state, and imaging the in-situ the population transfered by each pulse. 

We first prepare our BEC in the $\ket{F=1, m_f=0}$ state and apply a $17.0556$ G bias filed along the z axis. We then apply a pair of $250\mu s$ microwave pulses close to $6.83 GHz$ that transfers about $10\%$ of the atoms into the $F=2$ manifold. The pulses were detuned by $\pm 2\kHz$ from the $\ket{F=1,m_F=0}\leftrightarrow\ket{F=2,m_F=1}$ transition and were spaced in time by 2 periods of 60 Hz. We image the atoms transfered into $F=2$ non-destructively using absorption imaging without repumping light. The imbalance in the number of atoms transferred by each pulse gives us a $4\kHz$ wide error signal that we use both to feed forward our bias coils for active field stabilization, and also to keep track of the magnetic fields at each shot. We trigger our sequence to the line and both the microwave and Raman pulses are timed at integer periods of $60\Hz$ and performed at the zero-derivative point of the $60\Hz$ curve in order to minimize additional magnetic field fluctuations

%Just before transferring the BEC into |mF = −1, kx = 2kRi, two 6.8 GHz microwave pulses
%spaced in time by 50 ms each out-coupled ≈10% of the atoms to the f = 2 hyperfine manifold.
%These atoms were separately imaged (without repumping on the f = 1–2 transition) leaving
%the atoms in f = 1 undisturbed. These f = 2 atoms served two purposes: (i) by setting the
%microwave frequency 2 kHz above (first pulse) and 2 kHz below (second pulse) resonance, we
%tracked shifts in the bias field that would change our four-photon Raman resonance condition.
%Upon analysing the data, we rejected points where the atom number difference between these
%two images was greater than two standard deviations from being equal; (ii) we determined
%the BEC’s position immediately before each zitterbewegung experiment began, allowing us
%to cancel shot-to-shot variations in the trap position. The beginning of the three transfer
%pulses—two microwave outcoupling pulses, and the final four-photon Raman pulse—were each
%separated in time by 50 ms. As three periods of a 60 Hz cycle, this separation was chosen to
%reduce magnetic field background fluctuations at the power line frequency, and to facilitate
%rethermalization between pulses.
