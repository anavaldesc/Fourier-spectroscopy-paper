\subsection{Fourier Spectroscopy}		

The Fourier Spectroscopy technique takes advantage of the time evolution of a bare atomic state after a dressing field is suddenly turned. The initial state becomes a superposition of dressed states and it undergoes Rabi oscillations in time. The spectral components of these oscillations contain information about the energies of the dressed states. 

Aqu√≠ algo sobre el caso particular de las energias SOC.

The measurement can be simplified by noticing that a non-moving atom cloud in the laboratory reference frame dressed by a field with non-zero detuning is equivalent to a moving cloud with a resonant field in a suitable moving reference frame. As can also be seen in the Hamiltonian (citarlo aqui)  the detuning term $\delta/Er$  and the momentum term $4 k/k_R$ have the same effect in the energy differences.


For the case of our spin-orbit coupled BECs, the bare state
The system is let to evolve for a finite time T and afterwards the field is snapped off. A Stern-Gerlach pulse applied at our 21 ms time of flight (TOF) allows us to project the state of the condensate back into the bare $m_f$ basis.
