\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we can measure the spin and momentum dependent dispersion relation for a spin-1 spin-orbit coupled BEC using our Fourier spectroscopy thechnique. This method is good for any (effective) three level system with a quadratic Zeeman shift $\epsilon>4E_L$ and does not require any additional hardware as it relies only on the Hamiltonian evolution of the system. Our technique can also be useful to measure the Floquet quasi energy spectrum and the coupling within different Floquet manifolds for driven systems.
