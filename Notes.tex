Fixes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Write frequencies as $\omega_L$ and $\omega_L +\Delta\omega \pm\delta\omega$. Is there too many $\delta$ symbols, confusing?
	\item Call $J_0$ the zeroth order Bessel functions of the first kind.
	\item don't say modulation or multiple frequencies, just say we amplitude modulate by using 
	\item no effective model, say the floquet Hamiltonian takes de form
	\item mention 2 paths, aka Molmer?
	\item say something about spin one paper?
	\item sumar masa efectiva y comparar con 
	\item 
\end{itemize}




Corrections of the effective Hamiltonian are of the order $1/\delta\omega$.
