In analogy to solid state stuff we introduce a new Fourier based spectroscopy technique that we use to measure the spin dependent energy-momentum dispersion bands of the system. With the addition of a one dimensional optical lattice, this work opens the ground for measurements of the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum. 




Fixes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Write frequencies as $\omega_L$ and $\omega_L +\Delta\omega \pm\delta\omega$. Is there too many $\delta$ symbols, confusing?
	\item Call $J_0$ the zeroth order Bessel functions of the first kind.
	\item don't say modulation or multiple frequencies, just say we amplitude modulate by using 
	\item no effective model, say the floquet Hamiltonian takes de form
	\item mention 2 paths, aka Molmer?
	\item say something about spin one paper?
\end{itemize}




Corrections of the effective Hamiltonian are of the order $1/\delta\omega$.
